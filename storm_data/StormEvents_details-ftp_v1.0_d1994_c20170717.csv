Spotters estimated wind gusts to 60 mph about one mile south of Lennon around 1832 EST, in the extreme western portion of the county.  The storm then produced a series of funnel clouds and three separate damage swaths across the central part of the county from strong thunderstorm downburst winds, estimated as high as 100 mph in a post-storm damage survey.  The first area of significant damage, which began around 1845 EST, was on the west side of Flint where the strong winds blew large trees down onto homes and porches, power lines, and vehicles.  Several home television antennas were also blown down.  There was also damage to fences, and windows were blown out of homes and a few businesses.

As the first thunderstorm moved into southeast Chester County, it dropped its first tornado in London Britain Township near New London Road about 9:55 pm ESAINT  The    tornado reached its maximum intensity (F3 on the Fujita Scale) and destruction in the Hunter's Run Development on Crestwood Road.  Six homes were destroyed and twenty-three were damaged.  Eleven persons were injured.  A 40-year-old man was critically injured when he was blown through his 2nd story window.  Two teenagers were injured when a tree landed on their Ford Ranger Pickup.  The rest of the injuries were mainly from flying glass.  A gentleman's credit cards from London Britain were found 30 miles away.  Heavy damage was reported along Chesterville Road as the tornado passed into New Garden Township.  The worst damage in New Garden Township occurred to mushroom houses on Penn Green and Starr Roads.  Eleven mushroom houses were damaged, three had their roofs torn off, eight had collapsed walls. Although the tornado lifted close to Starr Road in New Garden Township, downburst wind damage continued father north into neighboring townships.  Even to the east of the tornado in London Britain Township, damaging wind gusts did massive damage in the White Clay Preserve and trees and wires were down on half the roads within the township.  Farther north thunderstorm downburst winds ripped the roof off a hanger in the New Garden Airport and damaged the roof of the Unionville Elementary School in East Marlborough Township.  Downed trees forced the closures of U.S. Routes 1 and 322 and Pennsylvania State Routes 41 and 162. Thunderstorm wind related damage continued north into Newlin Township and as the thunderstorm moved north into West Bradford, it dropped its second Chester County tornado of the evening.  The weaker (F1 on the Fujita Scale) tornado touched down about 10:20 pm EST near the intersection of Telegraph and Sugarbridge Roads and uprooted trees.  A mobile home on Sugar Bridge Road suffered severe damage to its porch and roof as a tree fell on it.  The tornado followed a discontinuous path through West Bradford and northern East Bradford Township before lifting near the intersection of Boot and Valley Creek Roads.  Most of the damage was uprooted trees and downed chimneys. Thunderstorm related wind damage was then reported in Downingtown with two foot diameter trees uprooted.  As the thunderstorm headed north, wind related damage diminished.  Just before it left Chester County, the thunderstorm split in two and the westward one entered Montgomery County near Limerick. The Chester County Office of Emergency Management estimated total damage in the county at $3.5 million with 9 houses or buildings totally destroyed and 49 other sustaining slight or moderate damage.",CSV

As the first thunderstorm moved into southeast Chester County, it dropped its first tornado in London Britain Township near New London Road about 9:55 pm ESAINT  The    tornado reached its maximum intensity (F3 on the Fujita Scale) and destruction in the Hunter's Run Development on Crestwood Road.  Six homes were destroyed and twenty-three were damaged.  Eleven persons were injured.  A 40-year-old man was critically injured when he was blown through his 2nd story window.  Two teenagers were injured when a tree landed on their Ford Ranger Pickup.  The rest of the injuries were mainly from flying glass.  A gentleman's credit cards from London Britain were found 30 miles away.  Heavy damage was reported along Chesterville Road as the tornado passed into New Garden Township.  The worst damage in New Garden Township occurred to mushroom houses on Penn Green and Starr Roads.  Eleven mushroom houses were damaged, three had their roofs torn off, eight had collapsed walls. Although the tornado lifted close to Starr Road in New Garden Township, downburst wind damage continued father north into neighboring townships.  Even to the east of the tornado in London Britain Township, damaging wind gusts did massive damage in the White Clay Preserve and trees and wires were down on half the roads within the township.  Farther north thunderstorm downburst winds ripped the roof off a hanger in the New Garden Airport and damaged the roof of the Unionville Elementary School in East Marlborough Township.  Downed trees forced the closures of U.S. Routes 1 and 322 and Pennsylvania State Routes 41 and 162. Thunderstorm wind related damage continued north into Newlin Township and as the thunderstorm moved north into West Bradford, it dropped its second Chester County tornado of the evening.  The weaker (F1 on the Fujita Scale) tornado touched down about 10:20 pm EST near the intersection of Telegraph and Sugarbridge Roads and uprooted trees.  A mobile home on Sugar Bridge Road suffered severe damage to its porch and roof as a tree fell on it.  The tornado followed a discontinuous path through West Bradford and northern East Bradford Township before lifting near the intersection of Boot and Valley Creek Roads.  Most of the damage was uprooted trees and downed chimneys. Thunderstorm related wind damage was then reported in Downingtown with two foot diameter trees uprooted.  As the thunderstorm headed north, wind related damage diminished.  Just before it left Chester County, the thunderstorm split in two and the westward one entered Montgomery County near Limerick. The Chester County Office of Emergency Management estimated total damage in the county at $3.5 million with 9 houses or buildings totally destroyed and 49 other sustaining slight or moderate damage.",CSV

Among the hardest hit areas were Greenfield Center, Wilton, Northumberland, Saratoga Springs, and Fort Miller.  At the Saratoga Spa State Park some 1,500 trees were uprooted or damaged.  Some of the trees fell on cars and on the grounds of the Saratoga Performing Arts Center forcing cancellation of a concert.  In Greenfield Center extensive damage occurred at the Utters Mobile Estates where at least five mobile homes sustained significant damage when trees fell on them.  In Fort Miller dozens of trees were uprooted or snapped off with some of the trees falling on homes while in Argyle a mobile home was flipped over.  Torrential rains during the storms resulted in urban flooding in Amsterdam, Saratoga Springs, Fort Edward, and Fort Miller.

Other damage from thunderstorm winds included trees which fell on a garage in Schaghticoke and a small chimney blown off a house in Malone.

One large two-story brick home (5300 square feet) took a direct hit in the Greystone subdivision and was reduced to rubble.  The only known fatality occurred in the lower bedroom ,of this structure.  The tornado threw the second story of the ,house 50 feet off the foundation while the first floor disin,tegrated. Ironically, upon inspection of the dislodged second floor of the home, stuffed animals remained intact and undisturbed on a  bedroom window sill.  Most of the homes that suffered major or complete damage in the Greystone subdivision were in a clear-cut zone.  Those homes  that were in wooded areas received the least amount of damage.   At Pinehurst Trace road near the Grayson subdivision, another home was lifted and blown across the road were it broke in half. Most of the damage was concentrated near Georgia Highway 84, one mile southwest of Grayson and along Ozora Church Road, two miles southeast of Grayson.  Damage estimates to property from this tornado was estimated at nearly 1 million dollars.  (F10P)",CSV

This time the storms were the result of a newly formed cold front and a strong upper level disturbance moved southeast across the state.  Thunderstorms remained below severe limits to a great extent.  They produced pea-size hail and winds gusting to 30 to 40 mph.  One storm moved over the Cedar Rapids Airport, producing a 46 mph wind guSAINT  Another storm did become severe over extreme eastern Iowa.  As it moved over Louisa County, it dropped dime-size hail on Columbus Junction, and produced 60 mph winds in Wapello.  The wind downed several trees in the city of Wapello.  The airmass over Iowa was very cold in the middle and upper levels.  During the later part of the afternoon, this led to the formation of several cold air funnel clouds over north central Iowa.  There were several reports from Pocahontas and Buena Vista Counties around 1700 CSAINT  Later in the evening, a tornado touched down in Clayton County.  It was actually a cold air funnel that reached the ground to become a tornado.  Damage was minimal as the tornado tracked across very sparsely populated open country.  The storm did produce some half inch diameter hail as it moved through the area.",CSV

A cold front arched southeast and south of the low across central South Dakota into eastern Nebraska during the late afternoon hours.  During the afternoon hours, the middle level dry slot raced north across Kansas, eastern Nebraska, into South Dakota.  The surface showed an unstable weather situation.  To the east of the cold front, which was actually more a dry line than a cold front, temperatures reached the upper 70s to lower 80s, with dew point temperatures in the lower to middle 60s.  Dew point temperatures briefly reach 70 at a few locations during the early evening hours.  Behind the dry line, dew point temperatures dropped to the upper 30s and 40s, with a few upper 20s in under the core of the dry slot.  Directional sheer was weak, however a strong speed sheer existed.  Lifted indices were around -5° C with a nearly 80 kt wind speed in the middle levels.  Helicity values increased to around 350 M2/S2 in the pre-storm environment.  A line of thunderstorms fired up during the mid to late afternoon hours.  The storms quickly became severe as they moved into western Iowa.  The hardest hit area was the west central counties where many areas were pelted with large hail.  Monona and Crawford Counties were especially hard hit as a series of severe storms moved northeast along the main line of storms.  There were numerous reports of golf ball size hail.  One storm produced baseball size hail as it passed over the Ute area of Monona County.  Baseball size hail also fell a short time later east of Soldier.  WSR-88D radar VIL values with this storm were in the 60-65 Kg/M-2 range with the storm.  A deep meso circulation was detected over northern Shelby and southern Crawford Counties with one of the storms.  A tornado warning was issued.  A funnel cloud was reported east of Defiance in Shelby County.  It became a tornado briefly south of Manilla near the Shelby/Crawford County line.  It passed through fields, causing some crop damage.  The tornado dissipated with only a funnel cloud remaining as it passed over Manilla.  A short time earlier, these storms produced golf ball size hail southeast of Earling in Shelby County.  One farmstead reported 5 windows being broken out by the hail.  Siding on the house was also damaged.  The storms weakened as the moved east during the early evening.  As the line advanced, a weak bow echo formed along the line.  This bow echo produced gusty winds of 55 to 60 MPH as it passed over Webster, Boone, Wright, and Winnebago Counties.  Damage was minor, however many trees were downed.  The roof of one building was blown off and strewn across a field near Gowrie in Webster County.  Part of a roof was torn off of a shed at Forest City in Winnebago County.  The roof was removed from another farm building on a farmstead near Stacyville in Mitchell County.  Damage was also reported west of Pilot Mound and north of Ogden in Boone County.  High winds destroyed a 60 X 100 foot farm building on a farm north of Ogden.  Damage on that farm was close to $50,000.  The storms continued east but weakened slightly.  Winds of 40 to 55 MPH were common, however the storms remained below severe levels through the rest of the night.",CSV

The dynamics were not very strong with the system, however the wind shear was sufficient enough to produce severe weather.  Low level winds were from the south-southeast with the middle and upper level flow fairly strong northweSAINT  Thunderstorms erupted during the afternoon.  The early storms produced a tornado over Emmet County.  The tornado tracked across several miles of open country before lifting north of Armstrong.  No significant damage was reported as the track was over bare ground.  The main severe weather associated with the storms was hail.  Although the storms did produce gusty winds in the 40 to 50 mph range, no severe winds were reported.  Golf ball-size hail fell north of Armstrong from the storm that produced the tornado.  Other storms formed in a line extending southwest from the tornadic cell.  Golf ball-size hail was also reported in Clay County at Royal.  As the storms progressed further southeast, the hail size diminished but not the amount.  What began as marble-size hail at Sioux Rapids in Buena Vista County grew to over an inch in diameter.  The hail fell for about a half hour, accumulating to a depth of two to four inches.  Hail accumulated to a depth of six inches in the town of Royal, giving the town a winter like appearance.  Pea-size hail covered the ground north of Algona and also in the northwest corner of Calhoun County.  In Calhoun County, southwest of Rockwell City, dime-size hail accumulated to a depth of one inch.  By the late afternoon hours, the hail size had diminished to one-half inch or less.  The storms tracked as far southeast as central Iowa before dissipating.",CSV

The setting was quite similar to the previous day except much of the activity was driven by synoptic scale dynamics.  A cold front was moving southeast across the state while an upper level wave was traveling east across the state.  The airmass was quite unstable in spite of the limited low level moisture.  Thunderstorms formed over the southern three tiers of Iowa's counties.  The trigger mechanism was a weak boundary settling south ahead of the cold front.  This boundary could be seen clearly on the WSR-88D radar.  Since inflow was much weaker over Iowa than the day before, the storms were not as wide spread.  A cell formed south of Des Moines and expanded into a short line extending southweSAINT  The new development was to the south and west of the initial cell.  No significant wind was reported with the cells, but hail was common.  Most of the hail reports were in the quarter-size to golf ball-size range.  Union, Wayne, Ringgold, and Decatur Counties were affected by the line.  The time each cell produced significant hail was quite short, on the order of 30 minutes or less.  The storms behaved as pulsar storms with the storm structure quite straight up and down.  Vertically Integrated Liquid values reached a high of 73 Kg-M-2 at the peak of the storms.  This is significantly above the threshold for late May.  The Kellerton area in Ringgold County was hard hit.  Hail ranging from quarter-size to golf ball-size fell for a long enough period of time to cover the ground.  By the early evening hours the storms moved and developed into northern Missouri.",CSV

The tornado sighting was phoned into the National Weather Service by a SKYWARN Spotter.  The tornado stayed on the ground for about one mile before lifting around Crossfield Road.  Most of the wind damage was downed or snapped (40 to 50) trees.  The bulk of the uprooted trees were either in poor health or very old.  Two houses were damaged by trees falling on them.  The worse one sustained about $6,000 in damage to its roof, porch, upstairs bathroom and gutters.  The tornado touched down within one mile of the King of Prussia Mall.  No injuries were reported.  This was the 12th confirmed tornado in the Greater Philadelphia Metropolitan Area this year. Elsewhere in Montgomery County damaging winds knocked over a centerfield fence and uprooted between 12 and 18 trees in Upper Gwynedd Township.  A lightning strike ignited a fire in an Upper Gwynedd house.  It apparently entered through the electrical box and started a fire in the basement.  Damage was estimated between $25,000 and $30,000.

Although the damaged neighborhoods were not declared federal disaster areas, FEMA officials were helping the city's Department of Housing and Community Development prepare applications for federal aid from HUD. The West-Central tornado began near the intersection of Edmonston Ave. and Monroe St, and moved northeast, just past the Harlem Park Elementary School.  The storm continued down Mosher Street before lifting at Mason Avenue a few blocks west of Interstate 83.  Many roofs were blown off row houses in the Harlem Park area.  Windows were blown out, and some building sides were blown down. The East-Central tornado began near the intersection of Federal Street and Greenmount along the west side of Greenmount Cemetary.  The tornado travelled east-northeast across Aisquith Street and the 1200 block of North Avenue, where the heaviest damage of all the storms was realized.  The tornado continued to Harford Road before lifting just west of Clifton Park.  Similar damage, to the upper floors and roofs of row houses, occurred with this tornado. Amazingly, no one was injured or killed, perhaps since the most affected were either at work or school.  A few eyewitness claim they saw a funnel cloud prior to damage occurrence.",CSV

Overall dynamics were weak, however weak moisture advection during the day combined with temperatures warming to around 90 degrees contributed to making the airmass quite unstable.  After taking into account the 90 degree temperature and the dew point around the 70 degree mark yielded a CAPE value of over 5000 J-Kg-1 by the late afternoon.  The severe storms were confined to a rather narrow area.  The first severe weather reported occurred over the far northwest Iowa, where three-quarter inch diameter hail fell at Sibley.  The storms drifted southeast and produced hail in Clay County as well.  Hail the size of quarters fell southwest of Spencer.  Webster County was hard hit with both hail and heavy rainfall.  Rain fell at the rate of two to three inches per hour in the Lizard Creek Basin.  This caused some minor flooding.  Street flooding also occurred in Fort Dodge.  No serious flooding occurred however.  It was generally urban flooding.  Southern Webster County was pelted by hail.  In the Harcourt area, dime-size hail accumulated to a depth of two inches.  Northwest of Harcourt, golf ball-size hail was reported.  Severe crop damage was reported to the corn crop in the area.  The storms produced two small tornadoes, although there were several other unconfirmed reports around the central part of the state.  One of the tornadoes touched down briefly in Hamilton County south of Webster City.  The other was north of Boone, in Boone County.  Neither of the tornadoes were on the ground very long and no significant damage was reported.  High winds became a problem as the storms moved toward central Iowa.  Winds of 60 mph were reported in the city of Boone.  High winds took down several large trees in the city of Marshalltown.  Most other reports during the afternoon and evening hours were of pea- to marble-size hail and 40 to 45 mph winds.  During the evening, a second area of storms that had formed over eastern South Dakota and Minnesota moved into northwest Iowa.  Most of them were not severe, though one did drop three-quarter inch diameter west of Le Mars before weakening.",CSV

The severe weather began in the morning around 0900 CST and continued throughout the day and into the nighttime hours.  The weather affected Alabama in waves with four waves of weather moving through the state.  In trying to unravel the events of the day after the fact, there is a great deal of confusion and uncertainty about the times of many events.  This stems from the fact that these waves of severe weather moved over many of the same counties three or four times.  Every attempt has been made to get this information as correct as possible.  It is also possible that some smaller events may not have been reported since there was so much attention drawn to the three major tornado events in Dekalb, SAINT Clair, Calhoun, Cherokee, and Shelby Counties.",CSV

The upper level high pressure built over the area.  Meanwhile, a weak upper level disturbance moved west into the state.  During the afternoon, the combination of heating and the upper level system was enough to finally break the cap.  Thunderstorms fired rapidly by the early afternoon hours.  The storms were mainly over the east half of Iowa.  The strongest storms were over the north-central counties.  Scattered reports of gusty winds were received over east-central Iowa.  Trees were downed in Cedar County, a large machine shed was destroyed in Clayton County, and wind damage was also reported in Clinton County.  The storms became tornadic over north-central Iowa.  The reports of funnel clouds were too numerous to mention.  Several touch downs occurred.  Since wind flow and shear were both weak, the tornadoes were short lived.  All but one of them were very weak tornadoes that touched down briefly in fields.  Although the tornadoes were weak, a report of the tornado in southern Kossuth County indicated that it was between 40 and 100 meters in width.  A strong tornado touched down in Garner, then moved south for about six miles.  At Garner, the tornado struck a country club.  Windows and doors were blown out at the club.  A cadillac was picked up and tossed 250 feet onto a green at the club.  The car was demolished.  Four golf carts were also lifted and thrown through the air by the tornado.  Windows were also blown out of a house in a nearby residential area.  After passing through the country club, the tornado caused structural damage to two other businesses.  The brick wall on one building was removed.  At the other, damage to the building structure was reported, though not as serious.  The rest of the tornado track was through open country south of Garner.  The other fairly strong tornado touched down south of Britt.  It caused damage to the two farmsteads that it moved through.  The first farmstead it hit was vacant, the second was not.  No injuries were reported, however several farm buildings and two silos were destroyed.  The tornado formed first as two separate funnel clouds.  The two merged, descended, and became a tornado south of Britt.  The tornado moved southwest and became stationary in a field.  The tornado reported grew in size as it remained stationary.  It remained for a while before dissipating after a few minutes.",CSV

There were a total of three factors contributing to the formation of the storms.  First off, Iowa was in the left front quadrant of the upper level jet.  The second factor was of course the weak frontal boundary.  The third factor that became important during the early evening hours was the outflow boundary from the afternoon convection.  The airmass was moderately unstable with CAPE values in the 1300 J-Kg-1 range.  Thunderstorms fired in northwest Iowa firSAINT  The main feature with the storms was hail.  The freezing level was around 10,000 feet MSL, with the wet bulb zero in the 7,000 foot range.  Most of the storms produced pea- to marble-size hail as they passed.  The stronger storms produced hail from dime-size to golf ball-size.  Golf ball-size hail was reported in Clay and Audubon Counties.  Most other reports were of hail three-quarters of an inch or less in diameter.  The storms also produced gusty winds, but winds were generally below 50 mph with the strongest storms.  One funnel cloud was observed northeast of Audubon.  It did not last long, and did not become a tornado.  As the evening progressed, the initial line of storms advanced southeast across central Iowa.  The next severe storms developed at the intersection of the outflow boundary from the afternoon convection and the weak frontal boundary.  The outflow boundary was easily detected by the WSR-88D radar.  The storms that formed in southwest Iowa at the intersection point became severe and produced large hail.  One of the storms produced the golf ball-size hail in Audubon County.  Though damage was spotty, significant damage was reported to the field crops due to the hail.",CSV

The newly strengthened tornado then continued its movement east, crossing the U.S. 27 expressway, damaging the roofs of three houses and blowing over numerous large trees before it lifted, just after crossing Interstate 75.  In all, more than 1,000 trees were destroyed, and at least five residences suffered some degree of damage.  The worst damage was done to a residence along South Grayling Road, where virtually all of the large oaks around the house were torn down, doing extensive roof damage estimated at around $8,000.

The tornado sighting was phoned into the National Weather Service by a SKYWARN Spotter.  The tornado stayed on the ground for about one mile before lifting around Crossfield Road.  Most of the wind damage was downed or snapped (40 to 50) trees.  The bulk of the uprooted trees were either in poor health or very old.  Two houses were damaged by trees falling on them.  The worse one sustained about $6,000 in damage to its roof, porch, upstairs bathroom and gutters.  The tornado touched down within one mile of the King of Prussia Mall.  No injuries were reported.  This was the 12th confirmed tornado in the Greater Philadelphia Metropolitan Area this year. Elsewhere in Montgomery County damaging winds knocked over a centerfield fence and uprooted between 12 and 18 trees in Upper Gwynedd Township.  A lightning strike ignited a fire in an Upper Gwynedd house.  It apparently entered through the electrical box and started a fire in the basement.  Damage was estimated between $25,000 and $30,000.  Thunderstorm winds uprooted a large pear tree in Audubon.  Frequent lightning resulted in power outages to 55,000 Philadelphia Electric Company (PECO) customers throughout their service area.",CSV

The tornado sighting was phoned into the National Weather Service by a SKYWARN Spotter.  The tornado stayed on the ground for about one mile before lifting around Crossfield Road.  Most of the wind damage was downed or snapped (40 to 50) trees.  The bulk of the uprooted trees were either in poor health or very old.  Two houses were damaged by trees falling on them.  The worse one sustained about $6,000 in damage to its roof, porch, upstairs bathroom and gutters.  The tornado touched down within one mile of the King of Prussia Mall.  No injuries were reported.  This was the 12th confirmed tornado in the Greater Philadelphia Metropolitan Area this year. Elsewhere in Montgomery County damaging winds knocked over a centerfield fence and uprooted between 12 and 18 trees in Upper Gwynedd Township.  A lightning strike ignited a fire in an Upper Gwynedd house.  It apparently entered through the electrical box and started a fire in the basement.  Damage was estimated between $25,000 and $30,000.  Thunderstorm winds uprooted a large pear tree in Audubon.  Frequent lightning resulted in power outages to 55,000 Philadelphia Electric Company (PECO) customers throughout their service area.",CSV

Lifted indices were in the -10 to -12 °C. range with convective available potential energy values around 5000 J-Kg-1.  During the day, a weak cold front sank slowly south across Iowa.  By the late afternoon hours it had become stationary along the southern Iowa border, extending into southern Nebraska.  A fairly strong southerly flow of moist air impinged on the front during the late afternoon and evening hours.  This aided in the formation of a mesoscale convective complex.  Iowa was on the far northeast edge of the complex and thus severe weather was somewhat limited.  There were reports of hail and high winds over the southwest quarter of Iowa.  Much of the severe weather was over the extreme southwest counties.  Hail was under an inch in diameter, while wind gusts were generally around 60 MPH with the stronger storms.  During the middle evening hours, gusty winds developed over the northwest and west central counties of the state.  It is believed these winds were the result of a rear inflow jet on the back side of the mesoscale convective complex.  Winds profiler data tended to support this idea and fit with literature written on the subject.  The winds blew from the east to southeast at 40 to 50 MPH at Sioux City and Little Sioux for about 2 hours.  Winds returned to normal by midnight.",CSV

This day's rain caused more flash flooding, this time in Terry County (especially at Brownfield and also in Union, where a school was flooded), in Lubbock County (especially in Lubbock where several main roads were closed due to water for two to three days), in Lynn and Crosby Counties (where the sheriff's offices reported many roads under water), in Midland County (especially in Midland where many roads were flooded and cars stranded; some by as much as three feet of water), and in Mitchell, Nolan, and Howard Counties (where many roads were flooded in each county).  The extreme rainfall caused river flooding along Beals Creek (in eastern Howard and southern Mitchell Counties) and on the Colorado River (in southern Mitchell and northwest Coke Counties). Witnesses reported that the Colorado River was 1.5 miles wide at the peak of flooding about 1900 CST on the 11th.  No significant flood damage was reported.  There were also many reports of severe weather. Large hail fell in Ector County (west of Odessa), and golf ball-size hail fell in Upton County (in McCamey) and in Sterling County (near Sterling).  There were also reports of up to quarter-size hail in many areas.  Three tornadoes occurred this day.  In Pecos County, the Girvin Fire Department reported a tornado that lasted about 10 minutes, but caused no damage.  An Abilene TV film crew reported a brief tornado in Mitchell County about five miles south of Colorado City, and storm spotters reported another brief tornado in Nolan County about eight miles southwest of Roscoe.  Lightning caused about $12,000 damage to a house in Lubbock.  This occurred when lightning struck the garage, causing a fire that also damaged a car in the garage.",CSV

During the early morning hours, three other features combined to once again produce severe weather in the state.  The surface dry line was advancing east across Kansas and southeast Nebraska.  At the same time a strong low level jet had become established with speeds in excess of 55 kts.  Above this a strong jet stream was in place in the upper levels.  What is known as a speed maximum (a jet streak) rotated around the upper trough and ejected toward Iowa.  This set the stage for rekindling of strong thunderstorms.  At this time, moisture was much more limited so thunderstorms were more of the pulse variety and were not able to maintain their strength as in a supercell storm.  Hail and winds were the trademarks of these storms.  Hail of three-quarters of an inch to one inch in diameter pelted Adams and Adair Counties.  Many of the other storms only produced pea- to occasional marble-size hail.  One storm became quiet strong for a while.  It was the southern most storm in the line.  It produced 60 mph winds as it passed through both Greenfield and Corning.  Another storm developed a couple hours later and moved into central Iowa.  High winds blew into the west part of Ames causing damage to trees and buildings.  A tornado developed on the southwest part of the storm a short time later.  It tracked through the western parts of the city.  It touched down near new United States Highway 30 and lifted as it crossed old Highway 30.  Several buildings were damaged or destroyed.  Windows were broken out on several houses and cars in the area.  Power was knocked out in the area as well.",CSV

The situation was similar to several others that occurred during the early spring with the exception that the moisture made it into the system in advance of the dynamics.  Low pressure moved across Kansas and headed northeast into Iowa during the late afternoon and early evening hours.  A warm front extended east from the low.  To the south of the front was moist and very unstable air.  The upper air sounding from the evening of the 14th from Topeka, Kansas indicated considerable instability.  It revealed a CAPE (convective available potential energy) value of over 2600 J-Kg-1.  Other indices also showed a great deal of instability.  During the early evening, a strong southerly low level flow transported this moist and unstable air into Iowa.  Thunderstorms erupted explosively over southwest Iowa during the early evening hours.  What began as an area over the southwest counties rapidly developed northeast across the rest of the state.  Severe weather was widespread from southwest through central into east-central Iowa.  During the later evening hours, the entire area of thunderstorms sagged southeast into the moisture feed.  Many of the storms produced winds of 35 to 50 mph and almost all produced at least pea- to marble-size hail.  By far, the most significant severe weather feature with the storms was the hail.  High winds from some of the storms resulted in damage and overturned tractor-semitrailers.  Four tractor-semitrailers were overturned on Interstate 29 west of Mondamin by 65 to 70 mph winds.  High winds later in the evening hours resulted in damage over eastern Iowa.  Winds gusted to around 75 mph at Ryan.  A pole barn was destroyed and a large barn knocked off of its foundation there.  Damage was reported at other locations around the state by winds in the 60 to 70 mph range.  An example was a barn that was destroyed by winds between Milton and Cantril in Van Buren County.  Many tin construction buildings were damaged or destroyed.  Serious wind damage occurred across the central part of the state.  During the mid evening hours the storms developed into a bow echo configuration.  The bow echo formed near central Iowa in Madison County.  The bow echo then accelerated northeast across Dallas and Story Counties before breaking apart.  Storm centroid movements from the WSR-88D radar at Johnston indicated the movement increased from 30 to 35 mph to around 55 mph within the bow echo.  A broad swath of damage occurred with the bow echo.  In the early stages, what appeared to be a gust front, or gustnado, touched down briefly in Macksburg.  The first widespread damage from it was in Madison County south of Booneville.  High winds of around 90 to 95 mph flattened two houses, 10 barns, and numerous out buildings.  Damage in the area was estimated at $500,000 to $600,000.  The same storm damaged two buildings and destroyed two large grain bins near Winterset a short time earlier.  The high winds swept northeast into the Booneville area, where a farmstead was damaged.  Sixty to seventy thousand dollars damage occurred to the farmstead.  Structural damage occurred to the farm house and the ends were blown out of the barn.  Debris was strewn across the road.  The high winds continued northeast and could be traced into southern Story County.  The damage path from the bow echo was about 10 miles wide.  As the storm system crossed Interstate 35, at least five cars were blown off the road and two tractor-semitrailers were overturned at the 105 mile marker.  The drivers of the two trucks sustained minor injuries, but did not require hospitalization.  Farther north, damage was reported in the Ames area.  A tractor-semitrailer was overturned just south of Ames and several grain bins were downed west of town.  The bow echo eventually broke up, but scattered reports of high winds continued into Tama County and farther northeaSAINT  Hail accompanied most of the storms.  All along the path of the bow echo metal buildings were damaged or flattened.  Tin from them was strewn along fields downwind from one-half to one mile.  Many areas reported 0.75- to 1.50-inch diameter hail.  The most significant hail occurred over southwest Iowa with the initial development and with the bow echo.  Golf ball-size hail pelted Cass, Pottawattamie, and Mills Counties.  The largest hail reports came from Cass and Adair Counties.  Three-inch diameter hail was reported southeast of Griswold in Cass County and south of Adair in Adair County.  VIL (Vertical Intergrated Liquid) values from the WSR-88D were as high as 77 Kg-M-2 were indicated.  Large hail also occurred with the bow echo.  Numerous reports of up to golf ball-size hail were received with its passage.  Over the northern sections of the Des Moines metropolitan area, baseball-size hail was reported.  As the entire area of storms advanced east, the size of the hail dropped off.  Reports over eastern Iowa were generally around 0.50- to 0.75-inch.  Hail damage was mainly to property.  Significant damage occurred to cars as well as roofs due to the hail.  Crop damage was limited as most of the crop had not yet been planted.  Some damage occurred to winter wheat and oats over the southwest counties, however.  Two other tornadoes occurred.  The first was with the cells over western into central Iowa.  One of them took on more of a supercell structure and spawned a brief tornado touchdown in the Fontanelle area.  Damage was minor with this tornado as it traversed open country.  Another tornado touched down in Marshall County north of State Center.  It caused damage at one farm stead there.  A barn was destroyed, a metal machine shed damaged, another shed moved off of its foundation, and some structural damage to two houses there.  Several trees were snapped off as well as a one permanent road sign.  Lightning struck a house in Des Moines as the line passed.  Lightning blew a hole in the roof and caused a small fire.  Damage was about $3,500.  During the later evening hours, the thunderstorms propagated eaSAINT  At the same time another area of thunderstorms developed and moved northeast out of Missouri.  As these storms moved across eastern Iowa, spotty wind and hail damage was reported.  Hail was generally around three-quarters of an inch or just above in diameter.  Gusty winds occurred with all of the storms, but most of the damage occurred in Delaware and Clinton Counties.  High winds caused roof damage in Grand Mound, and tore the roof off of a building in Elwood.  Both of these were in Clinton County.",CSV

The situation was similar to several others that occurred during the early spring with the exception that the moisture made it into the system in advance of the dynamics.  Low pressure moved across Kansas and headed northeast into Iowa during the late afternoon and early evening hours.  A warm front extended east from the low.  To the south of the front was moist and very unstable air.  The upper air sounding from the evening of the 14th from Topeka, Kansas indicated considerable instability.

Thunderstorm winds as high as 80 mph downed thousands of trees which fell on homes, vehicles, and powerlines.  In Saratoga County alone 20,000 customers were left without electricity.  Among the hardest hit areas were Greenfield Center, Wilton, Northumberland, Saratoga Springs, and Fort Miller.  At the Saratoga Spa State Park some 1,500 trees were uprooted or damaged.  Some of the trees fell on cars and on the grounds of the Saratoga Performing Arts Center forcing cancellation of a concert.  In Greenfield Center extensive damage occurred at the Utters Mobile Estates where at least five mobile homes sustained significant damage when trees fell on them.  In Fort Miller dozens of trees were uprooted or snapped off with some of the trees falling on homes while in Argyle a mobile home was flipped over.  Torrential rains during the storms resulted in urban flooding in Amsterdam, Saratoga Springs, Fort Edward, and Fort Miller.  Lightning was also a problem as a farmer and his daughter were injured when struck by lightning while on a farm tractor in Northumberland and a horse was struck and killed by lightning in Chatham.",CSV

Two supercell thunderstorms occurred north and west of Lubbock for about three hours.  The most intense occurred in Hockley County. This storm dumped hail and very heavy rain from Whitharral to near Smyer.  In some places, hail was at least six inches deep and rains totaled four to seven inches.  Most of the hail was small, but there were also reports of large damaging hail.  The hail smashed windows, stripped leaves and bark off trees, dented roofs and cars, and smashed over 15,000 acres of newly sprouting crops.  Damage estimates included about $100,000 to property and $300,000 to crops.  As this storm dissipated, it caused dime-size hail and a gust to 50 knots (58 mph) at Reese Air Force Base in western Lubbock County.  In Hale County, dime-size hail near Cotton Center wiped out a couple thousand acres of corn and cotton crops, and stripped several pine trees.  These two storms also caused flooding in northeast Hockley County and southwest Hale County, with sheriff's offices reporting many roads under water in those areas.  Elsewhere, The Department of Public Safety reported 60 mph winds just northeast of Eden in Concho County.  Later, the Concho County Sheriff's Office reported up to golf ball-size hail nine miles west of Eden at 1525 CST, and in Eden about 14 minutes later.  The Gaines County Sheriff's Office reported golf ball-size hail southwest of Seminole, and SKYWARN spotters reported 60 mph winds south of Seminole.  In Runnels County, the public reported tennisball-size hail five miles north of Ballinger.  A radio station reported wind damage in Ballinger, with roofs torn off of two stores, and many tree limbs downed and several trees uprooted.",CSV

Most of the hail was small, but there were also reports of large damaging hail.  The hail smashed windows, stripped leaves and bark off trees, dented roofs and cars, and smashed over 15,000 acres of newly sprouting crops.  Damage estimates included about $100,000 to property and $300,000 to crops.  As this storm dissipated, it caused dime-size hail and a gust to 50 knots (58 mph) at Reese Air Force Base in western Lubbock County.  In Hale County, dime-size hail near Cotton Center wiped out a couple thousand acres of corn and cotton crops, and stripped several pine trees.  These two storms also caused flooding in northeast Hockley County and southwest Hale County, with sheriff's offices reporting many roads under water in those areas.  Elsewhere, The Department of Public Safety reported 60 mph winds just northeast of Eden in Concho County.  Later, the Concho County Sheriff's Office reported up to golf ball-size hail nine miles west of Eden at 1525 CST, and in Eden about 14 minutes later.

The most significant damage of the day was at Prague, where winds estimated at up to 90 mph caused widespread damage across the community. Civil defense officials estimated the damage in Prague at $1,000,000. Winds knocked over the steeple at a local church and blew chain-link fences down. Several mobile homes were damaged and at least one was destroyed. Extensive damage was reported at the Prague High School, where a portion of the roof was ripped off by the winds, and the gym suffered significant water damage. The new scoreboard at the high school football field was bent to the ground. No injuries were reported from this storm. Across southeast Oklahoma, wind damage was reported near Atoka.

The left or western thunderstorm entered Montgomery County in Royersford and wind related damage intensified as the thunderstorm moved northeast through Royersford.  Most of the damage  (collapsed porches and downed trees) in Royerstown occurred from Fifth Avenue to Lewis Road and from Main to Chestnut Streets  Several homes were damaged by falling trees.  Lewis Road was closed for two days because of tree removal. From police and eyewitness reports apparently a funnel cloud was working its way toward the ground over Royersford and became a tornado in Limerick just to the northeast of Linfield Road at 10:45 pm ESAINT  The tornado intensified into a strong (F3 on the Fujita Scale) one as it paralleled Limerick Road on its western side.  A development called ""The Hamlet"" was in the direct path of this tornado.  The Hamlet was a new development started within the past 2 years and about 30 of the planned 430 units were occupied or under construction.  The  development took a direct hit from the tornado.  This resulted in 3 deaths (the same family) and 25 injuries.  Of the 27 inhabited houses, 4 were leveled, 16 were damaged beyond repair, 1 under construction was destroyed and only 7 remained liveable.  Damage in this development alone was $2 million.  The family of three which lost their lives lived on Victory Way.  They were asleep and blown out of their house.  The father was found on the front lawn.  The mother and her 10-month-old daughter were found over a sewer grate.  A United States Savings Bond in the child's name was found the next day in Bath, Pennsylvania.  Bath is located about 50 miles northeast in Northampton County.  Another man was blown through the second story window of his house about 50 feet into the family room of his neighbor's house and survived.  Equally miraculous a 5-month-old infant sailed out of his crib onto the front lawn of his home and survived. As tragic as the devastation was at ""The Hamlet"", it was not the only place in Limerick to sustain damage.  As the tornado traveled through the business area of the town,  it leveled most of the Hide and Seek Storage Sheds (damage estimated at $1 million). It peeled part of the roof off the Limerick Diner.  None of the 30 patrons inside  were injured.  The Atlantic and Sunoco Gas Stations sustained major damage.  Gasoline pumps at the Sunoco Station were wrenched from their cement foundation.  An overturned beige truck lay about 200 yards from where it was parked.  Even the Limerick Fire House sustained about $25,000 in wind damage.  In addition to ""The Hamlet"", 14 other homes in Limerick sustained major damage.  About 90 persons in Limerick had to find temporary shelter.  Total damage in Limerick alone was estimated between $5 and $5.5 million. The tornado lifted in the Limerick Garden of Memories Cemetery, but its parent thunderstorm continued to produce wind related damage in upper (northwestern) Montgomery County.  Downed trees were reported in Zieglersville.  In Marlboro Township about 50 to 60 trees were uprooted on Swamp Creek and Miller Roads.  About 10 properties were damaged by the falling trees, including one house that had six trees on top of it.  A lightning ignited fire extensively damaged a West Marlborough home.  It took six fire companies to get it under control. (M28P), (F28P), (F1P)",CSV

Thunderstorm winds downed trees and powerlines in many areas while intense lightning started several fires and killed a man in Albany.  In addition torrential downpours resulted in some flash flooding as well as flooding of poorly drained low lying areas.  Among the areas hardest hit were the Capital District Region where over 10,000 customers were left without electricity.  In Albany a 34 year-old man was struck and killed by lightning as he was holding a metal weed trimmer, while a horse standing in a field near a tree was struck and killed by lightning in Fort Ann.  Other areas hard hit included Saugerties, Norwich, Leonarrowdsville, and Kingsbury where numerous trees were downed some of which fell on cars and homes.  Urban Flooding was reported in Mechanicville and Hudson Falls as storm drains backed up.  While flash flooding occurred in Tioga County where many creeks were out of their banks and in northern Sullivan County where up to two feet of water was across roads from Roscoe to Lake Muskoday to Basket and trees were downed by flood waters.

Thunderstorm winds downed trees and powerlines in many areas while intense lightning started several fires and killed a man in Albany.  In addition torrential downpours resulted in some flash flooding as well as flooding of poorly drained low lying areas.  Among the areas hardest hit were the Capital District Region where over 10,000 customers were left without electricity.  In Albany a 34 year-old man was struck and killed by lightning as he was holding a metal weed trimmer, while a horse standing in a field near a tree was struck and killed by lightning in Fort Ann.  Other areas hard hit included Saugerties, Norwich, Leonarrowdsville, and Kingsbury where numerous trees were downed some of which fell on cars and homes.  Urban Flooding was reported in Mechanicville and Hudson Falls as storm drains backed up.  While flash flooding occurred in Tioga County where many creeks were out of their banks and in northern Sullivan County where up to two feet of water was across roads from Roscoe to Lake Muskoday to Basket and trees were downed by flood waters.

Among the areas hardest hit were the Capital District Region where over 10,000 customers were left without electricity.  In Albany a 34 year-old man was struck and killed by lightning as he was holding a metal weed trimmer, while a horse standing in a field near a tree was struck and killed by lightning in Fort Ann.  Other areas hard hit included Saugerties, Norwich, Leonarrowdsville, and Kingsbury where numerous trees were downed some of which fell on cars and homes.  Urban Flooding was reported in Mechanicville and Hudson Falls as storm drains backed up.

The most damage occurred around Carlisle where the roof of a restaurant was removed and homes and mobile homes were damaged - and at the end of its track at Cowpens where nearly $80,000 damage was done to homes and mobile homes.  At Cowpens, one resident watched the tornado become stationary for a minute or so in an open field just before it dissipated.  The tornado crossed into Cherokee County at 1600EST and into Spartanburg County at 1620ESAINT  Spotters were able to follow both the above tornadoes for most of their paths through Union County.",CSV

The left or western thunderstorm entered Montgomery County in Royersford and wind related damage intensified as the thunderstorm moved northeast through Royersford.  Most of the damage  (collapsed porches and downed trees) in Royerstown occurred from Fifth Avenue to Lewis Road and from Main to Chestnut Streets  Several homes were damaged by falling trees.  Lewis Road was closed for two days because of tree removal. From police and eyewitness reports apparently a funnel cloud was working its way toward the ground over Royersford and became a tornado in Limerick just to the northeast of Linfield Road at 10:45 pm ESAINT  The tornado intensified into a strong (F3 on the Fujita Scale) one as it paralleled Limerick Road on its western side.  A development called ""The Hamlet"" was in the direct path of this tornado.  The Hamlet was a new development started within the past 2 years and about 30 of the planned 430 units were occupied or under construction.  The  development took a direct hit from the tornado.  This resulted in 3 deaths (the same family) and 25 injuries.  Of the 27 inhabited houses, 4 were leveled, 16 were damaged beyond repair, 1 under construction was destroyed and only 7 remained liveable.  Damage in this development alone was $2 million.  The family of three which lost their lives lived on Victory Way.  They were asleep and blown out of their house.  The father was found on the front lawn.  The mother and her 10-month-old daughter were found over a sewer grate.  A United States Savings Bond in the child's name was found the next day in Bath, Pennsylvania.  Bath is located about 50 miles northeast in Northampton County.  Another man was blown through the second story window of his house about 50 feet into the family room of his neighbor's house and survived.  Equally miraculous a 5-month-old infant sailed out of his crib onto the front lawn of his home and survived. As tragic as the devastation was at ""The Hamlet"", it was not the only place in Limerick to sustain damage.  As the tornado traveled through the business area of the town,  it leveled most of the Hide and Seek Storage Sheds (damage estimated at $1 million). It peeled part of the roof off the Limerick Diner.  None of the 30 patrons inside  were injured.  The Atlantic and Sunoco Gas Stations sustained major damage.  Gasoline pumps at the Sunoco Station were wrenched from their cement foundation.  An overturned beige truck lay about 200 yards from where it was parked.  Even the Limerick Fire House sustained about $25,000 in wind damage.  In addition to ""The Hamlet"", 14 other homes in Limerick sustained major damage.  About 90 persons in Limerick had to find temporary shelter.  Total damage in Limerick alone was estimated between $5 and $5.5 million. The tornado lifted in the Limerick Garden of Memories Cemetery, but its parent thunderstorm continued to produce wind related damage in upper (northwestern) Montgomery County.  Downed trees were reported in Zieglersville.  In Marlboro Township about 50 to 60 trees were uprooted on Swamp Creek and Miller Roads.  About 10 properties were damaged by the falling trees, including one house that had six trees on top of it.  A lightning ignited fire extensively damaged a West Marlborough home.  It took six fire companies to get it under control. (M28P), (F28P), (F1P)",CSV

Thunderstorm outflow from these storms is believed to help enhance the development of a second round of severe thunderstorms which developed in western Oklahoma and moved into north Texas. In Oklahoma these storms produced winds measured up to 113 miles per hour, hail softball to football size, and 2 tornadoes. The severe thunderstorms were located along 2 main paths. The first area of storms moved into Oklahoma along the Kansas border near Manchester. These storms remained produced damage along a path extending southward to an area between Richland and the area southwest of El Reno in Canadian County. Of the 500 to 800 permanent homes and businesses that were damaged by the first area of severe thunderstorms, all were damaged by large hail driven by high winds. In virtually every case, damage was on the north side of the buildings. Buildings in several areas received lesser damage on the east side, while very few were damaged on the west side. None were damaged on the south side. Damage consisted of dented or perforated siding (including 3 to 4 inch dents and holes in some cases), or broken windows (hail passed through the walls in some cases). A significant number of permanent homes and businesses examined suffered enough damage to render them temporarily unusable. Mobile homes suffered far worse damage than did permanent structures in the same area. Those oriented north-south fared much better than those oriented east-west, but in virtually all cases the windward sides were severely dented, and in some cases stripped of siding. Windows and doors on windward sides were shattered. In several cases, hail was driven through the sides and the roof, and accumulated inside the mobile home. It was estimated that less than one-forth of the 80 to 120 mobile homes that were damaged were liveable immediately afterward, and more than half were damaged beyond repair. Numerous barns, sheds, silos, etc. suffered major damage; several barns were levelled. High winds caused most of the damage. Several hundred utility poles were downed by the storm. Windows on several hundred vehicles were shattered by hail, in many cases there was no glass left on the vehicle. Dents on the sides and tops of cars, trucks, RV's, etc, were several inches in diameter in some cases. Damage to trees and shrubs was extensive, especially in the Lahoma and Drummond area where virtually every deciduous tree within miles, and most of the evergreen trees, were stripped of leaves by the hail. There were few uprooted trees; most of the trees that were damaged by wind were either snapped off near the trunk (a few over 3 feet in diameter) or had large branches removed. Lawns and fields in some areas were beaten into a brown-green mulch. There were places along the storm path where no green vegetation could be seen in any direction. A detailed description of specific damage along selected areas along the storms path follows: ALFALFA COUNTY. Winds downed power poles and tore the roof off a barn 8 miles west of Manchester. Trees limbs were downed 4 miles south, 3 miles west of Manchester. Trees were downed at Goltry. FROM MENO TO LAHOMA TO 5 MILES EAST OF LAHOMA. Widespread damage occurred from 2.5 miles east of Meno to 3 miles east of Lahoma. The storms struck Lahoma between 2:45 PM and 3 PM and was observed as a large cloud of dust approaching from the north. Few, if any, structures in Lahoma were left undamaged, with most damage being in the form of stripped or damaged siding on the north and east sides of buildings. In Lahoma, 102 residences were damaged or destroyed (25 mobile homes and one house destroyed, 5 mobile homes and 25 homes with major damage, and 6 mobile homes and 40 houses with minor damage.) The Lahoma Post Office and the Cimarron School suffered roof damage. Several businesses were damaged, including an RV dealership that lost its entire inventory of RV's and travel trailers, with the loss estimated at $500,000. The Oklahoma Mesonet site 2 miles west of Lahoma (3 miles east of Meno) recorded onset of strong winds between 2:40 and 2:45 PM - a five minute peak gust of 86 miles per hour. It then recorded a five minute winds speed of 78 miles per hour and a peak gust of 113 miles per hour, measured by wind instruments approximately 33 feet above the ground. Another peak gust of 113 miles per hour was measured between 2:50 and 2:55 PM, before the wind equipment was damaged. (Based on damage assessment, peak ground-level winds were estimated to be 75 to 100 MPH.) Several people suffered minor injuries from broken glass, and bruises from hail (the exact number is unknown). Three people were hospitalized, one for a concussion. Several people were treated for hypothermia. DRUMMOND AREA. Virtually every structure in Drummond suffered damage, mostly to windows, roofs, and siding on the north side. An 80 foot metal storage building was destroyed, exposing farm equipment and other contents. A barn 1/2 mile northeast of Drummond was destroyed, and the debris was deposited 1/2 mile to the south. Ten to 15 mobile homes on the north side of Drummond were destroyed or heavily damaged by hail; all were oriented north-south and suffered major damage on their north sides. 2 MILES SOUTH OF DRUMMOND. Tree and roof damage was found on several homes and outbuildings from 1.5 miles west to 2 miles east of Route 132. In a cemetery 1.5 miles west of Highway 132, several headstones were overturned, possibly by debris impact. The caretakers building was destroyed, and debris was spread 100 yards or more to the south. EAST OF LACEY. Within a 2 to 3 mile radius of the junction of routes 51 and 132, several large barns were damaged or destroyed and at least three power poles were downed. DOVER. Tree limbs and many power lines were downed. THE WEST SIDE OF KINGFISHER. Widespread damage occurred to trees, homes, windows, and outbuildings in and around the Lake Elmer area (4 miles west-northwest of downtown Kingfisher). A barn, with an estimated value of $80,000, was destroyed, and debris blown for several hundred yards to the south and southweSAINT Hail ranged from golfball size. One mobile home was destroyed. MEEKER ADDITION, 2.5 MILES SOUTH-SOUTHWEST OF KINGFISHER. Nearly every home was damaged by hail, all on the north side. Most homes also had minor roof damage. A total of 115 homes and eight apartments were damaged. Hail penetrated siding on some homes, leaving holes several inches in diameter. Another 17 homes received similar damage in a subdivision 1 mile northwest of the Meeker Addition. Divots in the ground, and dents or holes in exposed objects, indicate that a few hailstones were baseball size. 2.5 MILES WEST-SOUTHWEST OF KINGFISHER TO 4.5 MILES SOUTHWEST OF KINGFISHER. A small (F1) tornado touched down at 3:33 PM and moved south-southeast for 2 miles. A 40 foot aluminum trailer, parked east-west, was lifted over a pickup truck parked to its south and dropped on its side 40 to 50 feet to the south. The pickup was rolled about 20 feet to the south and ended up on a pile of bricks and farm accessories, with its nose about 6 to 8 feet off the ground. Based on eyewitness reports this was probably a gustnado which formed along the leading edge of the storm. 5 MILES SOUTHWEST OF KINGFISHER ALONG HIGHWAY 81. A motorist drove into large hail at this point at 3:48 PM. He suffered extreme hail damage to his vehicle. The windshield and back window were completely broken out, and there was severe damage to the body of the truck. He then continued south on Highway 81 to the Okarche Police Department to warn them of the approaching storm. The policeman who examined the truck reported a hailstone was lying in the bed of the truck which measured 4.5 inches by 6.5 inches and was said to ""look like a football"". ALONG HIGHWAY 3, 3.5 MILES SOUTHEAST OF OKARCHE. Between 30 to 40 mobile homes, all oriented east-west, were heavily damaged or destroyed by hail or strong winds estimated at 60 to 90 miles per hour. Eyewitnesses reported hail from baseball to softball size. All mobile homes were damaged on the north and east sides; siding was pounded, and all windows were broken. Roofs were lifted from at least 3 mobile homes, one of which disintegrated in a field 50 to 75 yards south of the mobile home from which it was lifted. One residents dog was beaten to death by the hail, and several chickens and ducks were also killed. 11 MILES WEST, 4 MILES SOUTH OF EL RENO.  Severe thunderstorm winds ripped the door off a storm cellar. Thunderstorm winds also caused other scattered areas of damage. Trees were downed 4 miles north-northwest of Rush Springs, and 4 miles north of Hastings, and trees and power lines were reported downed at Corum. A second area of thunderstorms developed over portions of Roger Mills County in northwest Oklahoma, and quickly became severe. A mobile home was blown on top of another mobile home 2 miles west-northwest of Hammon. The storms moved into Beckham County and began to produce widespread damage in the Elk City area. Two semis were blown over at a truck stop 2 miles west of Elk City. In the area 3 miles north of I-40 several houses sustained mostly minor roof damage. A house in Erick had a picture window and its framing blown in. As the center of highest winds then moved toward the city of Carter and strengthened, an F-1 gustnado developed. This gustnado moved from 1.5 miles north of Carter to 0.5 miles south of Carter. One and one-half miles north of Carter several barns were destroyed, and the debris was spread northwestward. A brick home had the east side garage door blown in and the garage roof blown northwestward. One mile north-northeast of Carter, a well-anchored mobile home was completely destroyed, and the debris spread westward. The straps and concrete anchors were pulled from the ground. One and one quarter miles northwest of Carter, the tornado moved through a mobile home park where 3 out of 4 mobile homes were completely destroyed. The fourth mobile home received extensive damage but remained standing against the lower portion of several trees. Numerous trees on the south side of the park were completely sheared off 10 to 15 feet above the ground and carried a considerable distance across State Highway 34. The Carter School had extensive roof damage. Along the rest of the storm path, widespread damage was done by straight-line winds. Five and one-half miles south-southwest of Carter, a barn was destroyed, and a farmer lost 100% of his alfalfa, peanut and watermelon crops. Some fields which were ready for harvest the day before looked as if nothing had ever been planted. The strong winds continued moving into southwest Oklahoma. The area of strongest winds passed 2 to 3 miles west of the cities of Willow, Brinkman, and Mangum, but were still close enough to cause extensive damage. In Brinkman, 2 grain elevators received major damage. In Mangum, the entire city received winds of over 80 MPH for 5 to 7 minutes, with gusts in at least 2 areas over 100 MPH. The first area of damage from winds in excess of 100 MPH in Mangum was about 1 mile long and a few hundred yards wide extending from the fairgrounds on the far northwest side of the city south-southeast to about 1/2 mile north of the downtown area. At the fairgrounds a large span building had most of its roof and 2 walls blown down. Just southeast of this location a small wood frame house, a mobile home and several were completely destroyed. Signs and power poles were blown over. The Mangum Elementary School at the south end of this area of maximum winds had extensive wind damage to the roof and west walls. The 2nd area of strong winds around Mangum was located on the east side of the city, and was about 2 miles long. At the beginning (north end) of the damage path, several barns and outbuildings were damaged. The middle of this area had major roof and some wall damage to several brick houses. A 450 foot tall cable TV and communication tower located at the south end of this second damage area was toppled. In the area 1 mile east of Mangum, 2 people were trapped inside their truck when trees and power lines fell on top of the truck. Localized wind damage also continued some distance west of Mangum. A small hay barn 11 miles west of Mangum was blown down. A summary of damage from this second storm includes at least 8 mobile homes totally destroyed, at least some damage to 70 percent of the approximately 800 homes in Carter, Willow, Brinkman, Mangum, significant roof damage to about 20 businesses, and nearly total destruction of all outbuildings and barns in the direct path of the storms. The continuous damage path was about 42 miles long and 3 to 8 miles wide. There were no reported injuries with this 2nd area of storms. Wind damage also occurred in other areas away from this main damage path. Severe thunderstorm winds blew down an 80,000 pound oil drilling rig and truck carrier 2 miles north of Sentinel. Winds from isolated severe thunderstorms produced tree damage 4 miles south of Hastings and 4 miles south of Delhi. These storms continued their southward movement, where they caused intermittent damage across Jackson County and Tillman County before moving across the Red River into Texas. Power poles were reported downed in Frederick.",CSV

Thunderstorm outflow from these storms is believed to help enhance the development of a second round of severe thunderstorms which developed in western Oklahoma and moved into north Texas. In Oklahoma these storms produced winds measured up to 113 miles per hour, hail softball to football size, and 2 tornadoes. The severe thunderstorms were located along 2 main paths. The first area of storms moved into Oklahoma along the Kansas border near Manchester. These storms remained produced damage along a path extending southward to an area between Richland and the area southwest of El Reno in Canadian County. Of the 500 to 800 permanent homes and businesses that were damaged by the first area of severe thunderstorms, all were damaged by large hail driven by high winds. In virtually every case, damage was on the north side of the buildings. Buildings in several areas received lesser damage on the east side, while very few were damaged on the west side. None were damaged on the south side. Damage consisted of dented or perforated siding (including 3 to 4 inch dents and holes in some cases), or broken windows (hail passed through the walls in some cases). A significant number of permanent homes and businesses examined suffered enough damage to render them temporarily unusable. Mobile homes suffered far worse damage than did permanent structures in the same area. Those oriented north-south fared much better than those oriented east-west, but in virtually all cases the windward sides were severely dented, and in some cases stripped of siding. Windows and doors on windward sides were shattered. In several cases, hail was driven through the sides and the roof, and accumulated inside the mobile home. It was estimated that less than one-forth of the 80 to 120 mobile homes that were damaged were liveable immediately afterward, and more than half were damaged beyond repair. Numerous barns, sheds, silos, etc. suffered major damage; several barns were levelled. High winds caused most of the damage. Several hundred utility poles were downed by the storm. Windows on several hundred vehicles were shattered by hail, in many cases there was no glass left on the vehicle. Dents on the sides and tops of cars, trucks, RV's, etc, were several inches in diameter in some cases. Damage to trees and shrubs was extensive, especially in the Lahoma and Drummond area where virtually every deciduous tree within miles, and most of the evergreen trees, were stripped of leaves by the hail. There were few uprooted trees; most of the trees that were damaged by wind were either snapped off near the trunk (a few over 3 feet in diameter) or had large branches removed. Lawns and fields in some areas were beaten into a brown-green mulch. There were places along the storm path where no green vegetation could be seen in any direction. A detailed description of specific damage along selected areas along the storms path follows: ALFALFA COUNTY. Winds downed power poles and tore the roof off a barn 8 miles west of Manchester. Trees limbs were downed 4 miles south, 3 miles west of Manchester. Trees were downed at Goltry. FROM MENO TO LAHOMA TO 5 MILES EAST OF LAHOMA. Widespread damage occurred from 2.5 miles east of Meno to 3 miles east of Lahoma. The storms struck Lahoma between 2:45 PM and 3 PM and was observed as a large cloud of dust approaching from the north. Few, if any, structures in Lahoma were left undamaged, with most damage being in the form of stripped or damaged siding on the north and east sides of buildings. In Lahoma, 102 residences were damaged or destroyed (25 mobile homes and one house destroyed, 5 mobile homes and 25 homes with major damage, and 6 mobile homes and 40 houses with minor damage.) The Lahoma Post Office and the Cimarron School suffered roof damage. Several businesses were damaged, including an RV dealership that lost its entire inventory of RV's and travel trailers, with the loss estimated at $500,000. The Oklahoma Mesonet site 2 miles west of Lahoma (3 miles east of Meno) recorded onset of strong winds between 2:40 and 2:45 PM - a five minute peak gust of 86 miles per hour. It then recorded a five minute winds speed of 78 miles per hour and a peak gust of 113 miles per hour, measured by wind instruments approximately 33 feet above the ground. Another peak gust of 113 miles per hour was measured between 2:50 and 2:55 PM, before the wind equipment was damaged. (Based on damage assessment, peak ground-level winds were estimated to be 75 to 100 MPH.) Several people suffered minor injuries from broken glass, and bruises from hail (the exact number is unknown). Three people were hospitalized, one for a concussion. Several people were treated for hypothermia. DRUMMOND AREA. Virtually every structure in Drummond suffered damage, mostly to windows, roofs, and siding on the north side. An 80 foot metal storage building was destroyed, exposing farm equipment and other contents. A barn 1/2 mile northeast of Drummond was destroyed, and the debris was deposited 1/2 mile to the south. Ten to 15 mobile homes on the north side of Drummond were destroyed or heavily damaged by hail; all were oriented north-south and suffered major damage on their north sides. 2 MILES SOUTH OF DRUMMOND. Tree and roof damage was found on several homes and outbuildings from 1.5 miles west to 2 miles east of Route 132. In a cemetery 1.5 miles west of Highway 132, several headstones were overturned, possibly by debris impact. The caretakers building was destroyed, and debris was spread 100 yards or more to the south. EAST OF LACEY. Within a 2 to 3 mile radius of the junction of routes 51 and 132, several large barns were damaged or destroyed and at least three power poles were downed. DOVER. Tree limbs and many power lines were downed. THE WEST SIDE OF KINGFISHER.

In the area 1 mile east of Mangum, 2 people were trapped inside their truck when trees and power lines fell on top of the truck. Localized wind damage also continued some distance west of Mangum. A small hay barn 11 miles west of Mangum was blown down. A summary of damage from this second storm includes at least 8 mobile homes totally destroyed, at least some damage to 70 percent of the approximately 800 homes in Carter, Willow, Brinkman, Mangum, significant roof damage to about 20 businesses, and nearly total destruction of all outbuildings and barns in the direct path of the storms. The continuous damage path was about 42 miles long and 3 to 8 miles wide. There were no reported injuries with this 2nd area of storms. Wind damage also occurred in other areas away from this main damage path. Severe thunderstorm winds blew down an 80,000 pound oil drilling rig and truck carrier 2 miles north of Sentinel. Winds from isolated severe thunderstorms produced tree damage 4 miles south of Hastings and 4 miles south of Delhi. These storms continued their southward movement, where they caused intermittent damage across Jackson County and Tillman County before moving across the Red River into Texas. Power poles were reported downed in Frederick.",CSV

Thunderstorm outflow from these storms is believed to help enhance the development of a second round of severe thunderstorms which developed in western Oklahoma and moved into north Texas. In Oklahoma these storms produced winds measured up to 113 miles per hour, hail softball to football size, and 2 tornadoes. The severe thunderstorms were located along 2 main paths. The first area of storms moved into Oklahoma along the Kansas border near Manchester. These storms remained produced damage along a path extending southward to an area between Richland and the area southwest of El Reno in Canadian County. Of the 500 to 800 permanent homes and businesses that were damaged by the first area of severe thunderstorms, all were damaged by large hail driven by high winds. In virtually every case, damage was on the north side of the buildings. Buildings in several areas received lesser damage on the east side, while very few were damaged on the west side. None were damaged on the south side. Damage consisted of dented or perforated siding (including 3 to 4 inch dents and holes in some cases), or broken windows (hail passed through the walls in some cases). A significant number of permanent homes and businesses examined suffered enough damage to render them temporarily unusable. Mobile homes suffered far worse damage than did permanent structures in the same area. Those oriented north-south fared much better than those oriented east-west, but in virtually all cases the windward sides were severely dented, and in some cases stripped of siding. Windows and doors on windward sides were shattered. In several cases, hail was driven through the sides and the roof, and accumulated inside the mobile home. It was estimated that less than one-forth of the 80 to 120 mobile homes that were damaged were liveable immediately afterward, and more than half were damaged beyond repair. Numerous barns, sheds, silos, etc. suffered major damage; several barns were levelled. High winds caused most of the damage. Several hundred utility poles were downed by the storm. Windows on several hundred vehicles were shattered by hail, in many cases there was no glass left on the vehicle. Dents on the sides and tops of cars, trucks, RV's, etc, were several inches in diameter in some cases. Damage to trees and shrubs was extensive, especially in the Lahoma and Drummond area where virtually every deciduous tree within miles, and most of the evergreen trees, were stripped of leaves by the hail. There were few uprooted trees; most of the trees that were damaged by wind were either snapped off near the trunk (a few over 3 feet in diameter) or had large branches removed. Lawns and fields in some areas were beaten into a brown-green mulch. There were places along the storm path where no green vegetation could be seen in any direction. A detailed description of specific damage along selected areas along the storms path follows: ALFALFA COUNTY. Winds downed power poles and tore the roof off a barn 8 miles west of Manchester. Trees limbs were downed 4 miles south, 3 miles west of Manchester. Trees were downed at Goltry. FROM MENO TO LAHOMA TO 5 MILES EAST OF LAHOMA. Widespread damage occurred from 2.5 miles east of Meno to 3 miles east of Lahoma. The storms struck Lahoma between 2:45 PM and 3 PM and was observed as a large cloud of dust approaching from the north. Few, if any, structures in Lahoma were left undamaged, with most damage being in the form of stripped or damaged siding on the north and east sides of buildings. In Lahoma, 102 residences were damaged or destroyed (25 mobile homes and one house destroyed, 5 mobile homes and 25 homes with major damage, and 6 mobile homes and 40 houses with minor damage.) The Lahoma Post Office and the Cimarron School suffered roof damage. Several businesses were damaged, including an RV dealership that lost its entire inventory of RV's and travel trailers, with the loss estimated at $500,000. The Oklahoma Mesonet site 2 miles west of Lahoma (3 miles east of Meno) recorded onset of strong winds between 2:40 and 2:45 PM - a five minute peak gust of 86 miles per hour. It then recorded a five minute winds speed of 78 miles per hour and a peak gust of 113 miles per hour, measured by wind instruments approximately 33 feet above the ground. Another peak gust of 113 miles per hour was measured between 2:50 and 2:55 PM, before the wind equipment was damaged. (Based on damage assessment, peak ground-level winds were estimated to be 75 to 100 MPH.) Several people suffered minor injuries from broken glass, and bruises from hail (the exact number is unknown). Three people were hospitalized, one for a concussion. Several people were treated for hypothermia. DRUMMOND AREA. Virtually every structure in Drummond suffered damage, mostly to windows, roofs, and siding on the north side. An 80 foot metal storage building was destroyed, exposing farm equipment and other contents. A barn 1/2 mile northeast of Drummond was destroyed, and the debris was deposited 1/2 mile to the south. Ten to 15 mobile homes on the north side of Drummond were destroyed or heavily damaged by hail; all were oriented north-south and suffered major damage on their north sides. 2 MILES SOUTH OF DRUMMOND. Tree and roof damage was found on several homes and outbuildings from 1.5 miles west to 2 miles east of Route 132. In a cemetery 1.5 miles west of Highway 132, several headstones were overturned, possibly by debris impact. The caretakers building was destroyed, and debris was spread 100 yards or more to the south. EAST OF LACEY. Within a 2 to 3 mile radius of the junction of routes 51 and 132, several large barns were damaged or destroyed and at least three power poles were downed. DOVER. Tree limbs and many power lines were downed. THE WEST SIDE OF KINGFISHER. Widespread damage occurred to trees, homes, windows, and outbuildings in and around the Lake Elmer area (4 miles west-northwest of downtown Kingfisher). A barn, with an estimated value of $80,000, was destroyed, and debris blown for several hundred yards to the south and southweSAINT Hail ranged from golfball size. One mobile home was destroyed. MEEKER ADDITION, 2.5 MILES SOUTH-SOUTHWEST OF KINGFISHER. Nearly every home was damaged by hail, all on the north side. Most homes also had minor roof damage. A total of 115 homes and eight apartments were damaged. Hail penetrated siding on some homes, leaving holes several inches in diameter. Another 17 homes received similar damage in a subdivision 1 mile northwest of the Meeker Addition. Divots in the ground, and dents or holes in exposed objects, indicate that a few hailstones were baseball size. 2.5 MILES WEST-SOUTHWEST OF KINGFISHER TO 4.5 MILES SOUTHWEST OF KINGFISHER. A small (F1) tornado touched down at 3:33 PM and moved south-southeast for 2 miles. A 40 foot aluminum trailer, parked east-west, was lifted over a pickup truck parked to its south and dropped on its side 40 to 50 feet to the south. The pickup was rolled about 20 feet to the south and ended up on a pile of bricks and farm accessories, with its nose about 6 to 8 feet off the ground. Based on eyewitness reports this was probably a gustnado which formed along the leading edge of the storm. 5 MILES SOUTHWEST OF KINGFISHER ALONG HIGHWAY 81. A motorist drove into large hail at this point at 3:48 PM. He suffered extreme hail damage to his vehicle. The windshield and back window were completely broken out, and there was severe damage to the body of the truck. He then continued south on Highway 81 to the Okarche Police Department to warn them of the approaching storm. The policeman who examined the truck reported a hailstone was lying in the bed of the truck which measured 4.5 inches by 6.5 inches and was said to ""look like a football"". ALONG HIGHWAY 3, 3.5 MILES SOUTHEAST OF OKARCHE. Between 30 to 40 mobile homes, all oriented east-west, were heavily damaged or destroyed by hail or strong winds estimated at 60 to 90 miles per hour. Eyewitnesses reported hail from baseball to softball size. All mobile homes were damaged on the north and east sides; siding was pounded, and all windows were broken. Roofs were lifted from at least 3 mobile homes, one of which disintegrated in a field 50 to 75 yards south of the mobile home from which it was lifted. One residents dog was beaten to death by the hail, and several chickens and ducks were also killed. 11 MILES WEST, 4 MILES SOUTH OF EL RENO.  Severe thunderstorm winds ripped the door off a storm cellar. Thunderstorm winds also caused other scattered areas of damage. Trees were downed 4 miles north-northwest of Rush Springs, and 4 miles north of Hastings, and trees and power lines were reported downed at Corum. A second area of thunderstorms developed over portions of Roger Mills County in northwest Oklahoma, and quickly became severe. A mobile home was blown on top of another mobile home 2 miles west-northwest of Hammon. The storms moved into Beckham County and began to produce widespread damage in the Elk City area. Two semis were blown over at a truck stop 2 miles west of Elk City. In the area 3 miles north of I-40 several houses sustained mostly minor roof damage. A house in Erick had a picture window and its framing blown in. As the center of highest winds then moved toward the city of Carter and strengthened, an F-1 gustnado developed. This gustnado moved from 1.5 miles north of Carter to 0.5 miles south of Carter. One and one-half miles north of Carter several barns were destroyed, and the debris was spread northwestward. A brick home had the east side garage door blown in and the garage roof blown northwestward. One mile north-northeast of Carter, a well-anchored mobile home was completely destroyed, and the debris spread westward. The straps and concrete anchors were pulled from the ground. One and one quarter miles northwest of Carter, the tornado moved through a mobile home park where 3 out of 4 mobile homes were completely destroyed. The fourth mobile home received extensive damage but remained standing against the lower portion of several trees. Numerous trees on the south side of the park were completely sheared off 10 to 15 feet above the ground and carried a considerable distance across State Highway 34. The Carter School had extensive roof damage. Along the rest of the storm path, widespread damage was done by straight-line winds. Five and one-half miles south-southwest of Carter, a barn was destroyed, and a farmer lost 100% of his alfalfa, peanut and watermelon crops. Some fields which were ready for harvest the day before looked as if nothing had ever been planted. The strong winds continued moving into southwest Oklahoma. The area of strongest winds passed 2 to 3 miles west of the cities of Willow, Brinkman, and Mangum, but were still close enough to cause extensive damage. In Brinkman, 2 grain elevators received major damage. In Mangum, the entire city received winds of over 80 MPH for 5 to 7 minutes, with gusts in at least 2 areas over 100 MPH. The first area of damage from winds in excess of 100 MPH in Mangum was about 1 mile long and a few hundred yards wide extending from the fairgrounds on the far northwest side of the city south-southeast to about 1/2 mile north of the downtown area. At the fairgrounds a large span building had most of its roof and 2 walls blown down. Just southeast of this location a small wood frame house, a mobile home and several were completely destroyed. Signs and power poles were blown over. The Mangum Elementary School at the south end of this area of maximum winds had extensive wind damage to the roof and west walls. The 2nd area of strong winds around Mangum was located on the east side of the city, and was about 2 miles long. At the beginning (north end) of the damage path, several barns and outbuildings were damaged. The middle of this area had major roof and some wall damage to several brick houses. A 450 foot tall cable TV and communication tower located at the south end of this second damage area was toppled. In the area 1 mile east of Mangum, 2 people were trapped inside their truck when trees and power lines fell on top of the truck. Localized wind damage also continued some distance west of Mangum. A small hay barn 11 miles west of Mangum was blown down. A summary of damage from this second storm includes at least 8 mobile homes totally destroyed, at least some damage to 70 percent of the approximately 800 homes in Carter, Willow, Brinkman, Mangum, significant roof damage to about 20 businesses, and nearly total destruction of all outbuildings and barns in the direct path of the storms. The continuous damage path was about 42 miles long and 3 to 8 miles wide. There were no reported injuries with this 2nd area of storms. Wind damage also occurred in other areas away from this main damage path. Severe thunderstorm winds blew down an 80,000 pound oil drilling rig and truck carrier 2 miles north of Sentinel. Winds from isolated severe thunderstorms produced tree damage 4 miles south of Hastings and 4 miles south of Delhi. These storms continued their southward movement, where they caused intermittent damage across Jackson County and Tillman County before moving across the Red River into Texas. Power poles were reported downed in Frederick.",CSV

The upper level system was in part the result of convection that occurred the previous night across Nebraska.  During the afternoon hours, the disturbance, in combination with an increasing low level jet and old outflow boundary from the previous evenings convection, set off a small cluster of thunderstorms.  As the afternoon progressed, the outflow boundary from the new convection interacted with the low level jet and produced a line of storms.  For the most part, the storms produced gusty winds of 35 to 50 mph and pea- to marble-size hail.  Heavy rainfall also occurred.  Even though one to two and one-half inches of rain fell in a short period of time, flooding was very minor due to the very dry soil conditions.  The first report of severe weather came from Hamilton County, where a barn was blown over near Stratford.  A short time later, a 64 mph wind gust was reported at the Waterloo Airport.  The leading edge of the storms, actually the original cluster, moved into northeast Iowa and uprooted trees and downed several barns in Alamakee and Clayton Counties.  As the storms moved through Clayton County, high winds tore through the town of Garnavillo.  Several buildings received roof damage, a few were removed.  The line later moved through Linn County and knocked over trees and several sheds.  The roof was blown off of a house in Palo.  By late afternoon the storm intensity had diminished.  A couple small storms developed over southwest Iowa.  Once the outflow boundary intersected with one of them, a cell merger occurred over Taylor County.  The result was one inch diameter hail in Lenox.  The storm dissipated a short time later however.  As the thunderstorm passed over Warren County, a man was stuck by lightning on a golf course near Norwalk.  He walked dazed into the clubhouse and had a cut on his forehead.  He was taken to a local hospital and admitted in fair condition with a headache.  In Madison County, lightning struck an historical church build in 1881.  The bell tower was struck and toppled.  Although not severe in nature, considerable crop damage was reported in Dallas County near Perry.  Small hail accumulated to a depth of four inches in a 10 minute time span.  Severe damage was reported on 200 acres of soybeans and 350 acres of corn.  The screens were blown off of a farm house there by 50 mph winds, allowing the hail to accumulate inside the house.",CSV

Intense low pressure moved across western Kansas into southern Nebraska.  A warm front extended east from the low into Iowa.  Warm and moist air was in place over the state.  Surface dew point temperatures were in the lower to middle 60s with significant moisture extending above the 850 mb level.  Meanwhile, drier air was working its way northeast aloft.  Violent thunderstorms erupted during the late afternoon hours over northwest Iowa.  There were several reports of tornadoes just to the north of the Iowa/Minnesota border.  The storms moved into the northwest part of the state and produced hail, high winds, and funnel clouds.  Winds gusted to 63 mph at the Sioux City Gateway Airport.  A short time later three-quarter inch diameter hail pelted the area.  High winds caused damage in Plymouth County around LeMars.  Numerous trees and power lines were downed.  Part of a building was destroyed south of LeMars.  The local utility company recorded a wind gust of 75 mph.  A funnel cloud was sighted a short time earlier west of town.  The storms clipped the far northwest corner of the state as well.  Winds gusted to 78 mph at Sioux Center, causing damage around town.  A funnel cloud was sighted in Lyon County at Alvord.  A tornado also touched down in the area, a short distance east of Alvord.  It struck two farms, causing extensive damage to each.  Several buildings were downed on a farm near Hull, a machine shed, garage, and brooder coop were downed north of Hull.  The storms worked their way northeaSAINT  Hail the size of quarters was reported later in the evening in Kossuth County, southwest of Algona.  During this time, an area of thunderstorms developed over east-central Iowa.  One of them dropped hail the size of quarters at Clarence in Cedar County.  In Henry County, one-inch diameter was recorded at Mt. Pleasant.",CSV

Intense low pressure moved across western Kansas into southern Nebraska.  A warm front extended east from the low into Iowa.  Warm and moist air was in place over the state.  Surface dew point temperatures were in the lower to middle 60s with significant moisture extending above the 850 mb level.  Meanwhile, drier air was working its way northeast aloft.  Violent thunderstorms erupted during the late afternoon hours over northwest Iowa.  There were several reports of tornadoes just to the north of the Iowa/Minnesota border.  The storms moved into the northwest part of the state and produced hail, high winds, and funnel clouds.  Winds gusted to 63 mph at the Sioux City Gateway Airport.  A short time later three-quarter inch diameter hail pelted the area.  High winds caused damage in Plymouth County around LeMars.  Numerous trees and power lines were downed.  Part of a building was destroyed south of LeMars.  The local utility company recorded a wind gust of 75 mph.  A funnel cloud was sighted a short time earlier west of town.  The storms clipped the far northwest corner of the state as well.  Winds gusted to 78 mph at Sioux Center, causing damage around town.  A funnel cloud was sighted in Lyon County at Alvord.  A tornado also touched down in the area, a short distance east of Alvord.  It struck two farms, causing extensive damage to each.  Several buildings were downed on a farm near Hull, a machine shed, garage, and brooder coop were downed north of Hull.  The storms worked their way northeaSAINT  Hail the size of quarters was reported later in the evening in Kossuth County, southwest of Algona.  During this time, an area of thunderstorms developed over east-central Iowa.  One of them dropped hail the size of quarters at Clarence in Cedar County.

The storm continued down Mosher Street before lifting at Mason Avenue a few blocks west of Interstate 83.  Many roofs were blown off row houses in the Harlem Park area.  Windows were blown out, and some building sides were blown down. The East-Central tornado began near the intersection of Federal Street and Greenmount along the west side of Greenmount Cemetary.  The tornado travelled east-northeast across Aisquith Street and the 1200 block of North Avenue, where the heaviest damage of all the storms was realized.  The tornado continued to Harford Road before lifting just west of Clifton Park.  Similar damage, to the upper floors and roofs of row houses, occurred with this tornado.

This complex formed on the cold side of a decaying cold front that was moving southeast across the central U.S.  The front became stationary east to west across Iowa, aligned with the outflow boundary from the complex.  During the afternoon the airmass became very unstable.  Surface based lifted indices reach -12 with convective available potential energy values in the 1000 to 2000 J-Kg-1 range.  Thunderstorms erupted along the boundary.  Though most of them remained below severe limits, a few did produce severe weather.  High winds blew down trees and damaged a truck in Strawberry Point of Clayton County.  As the storms moved through Dubuque County, high winds broke at least 2 windows in one home, and tore shingles off the roof of another.  The line of storm developed southwest from those in northeast Iowa into the west central counties of the state.  From there, the line moved east and south.  Little in the way of severe weather was reported following the reports over northeast Iowa, though three quarter inch diameter hail did fall northwest of Guthrie Center, in Guthrie County.  Later, one cell dropped hail nearly an inch in diameter in Mills County at Pacific Junction.  The main event with these storms was the torrential rainfall.  Many areas received 1 to 2 inches of rain in under an hour.  Flash flooding became a problem in the Dallas and Madison County area.  WSR-88D radar precipitation estimates showed 2 1/2 to 3 1/2 inches of rain in many area of southern Dallas County into Madison County.  One spot indication from radar showed rainfall in excess of 3 1/2 inches.  Ground truth revealed that 4 inches of rain had fallen in 90 minutes in the town of Earlham, in Madison County.  Most of the rain that fell did so in less than 2 hours.  There were several reports of water overtopping roads from Madison County and the southern part of Dallas County.  The storms progressed east into Polk and Warren Counties.  Heavy rainfall occurred, but only briefly.  Reports of 1 to 1 1/2 inches of rain in under an hour were received.  This did cause some minor street flooding in the Des Moines metropolitan area, but no other significant flooding was reported.",CSV

Lauderdale County:  The tornado that began in Tennessee and moved across Iron City continued into Lauderdale County ending in the Lexington area.  The F-scale associated with this report reflecknots the damage that was caused in Tennessee.  Significant damage was done to more than 15 homes in the Mary's Chapel area just northwest of Lexington near the state line.  Two people were injured when their mobile home was overturned. Limestone County:  Another tornado (F3) touched down for a short path on the northwest side of Athens totally destroying one house.  No one was home at the time. A third tornado (F1) touched down about five miles east-southeast of Tanner and stayed on the ground for approximately five miles. In Elkmont, the top of a steel water tower weighing between two and three tons and measuring 30 feet by 10 feet was ripped off and blown 50 yards where it struck a car and the edge of a church. Madison County:  A fourth tornado was produced beginning on the north side of Madison continuing across the east side of Madison and extending into the northern portion of the Redstone Arsenal.  Homes and businesses were damaged or destroyed by the tornado as well as numerous trees downed.  Extensive damage in the Pebble Brook Subdivision and around Bob Jones High School. A man was injured when a tree fell on him on Old Madison Pike.  Over 300 trees were estimated to be blown down on the Redstone Golf Course.

During the early morning hours, three other features combined to once again produce severe weather in the state.  The surface dry line was advancing east across Kansas and southeast Nebraska.  At the same time a strong low level jet had become established with speeds in excess of 55 kts.  Above this a strong jet stream was in place in the upper levels.  What is known as a speed maximum (a jet streak) rotated around the upper trough and ejected toward Iowa.  This set the stage for rekindling of strong thunderstorms.  At this time, moisture was much more limited so thunderstorms were more of the pulse variety and were not able to maintain their strength as in a supercell storm.  Hail and winds were the trademarks of these storms.  Hail of three-quarters of an inch to one inch in diameter pelted Adams and Adair Counties.  Many of the other storms only produced pea- to occasional marble-size hail.  One storm became quiet strong for a while.  It was the southern most storm in the line.  It produced 60 mph winds as it passed through both Greenfield and Corning.  Another storm developed a couple hours later and moved into central Iowa.  High winds blew into the west part of Ames causing damage to trees and buildings.  A tornado developed on the southwest part of the storm a short time later.

These developed in response to an approaching cold front and an upper level trough moving through the north-central United States.  Moisture streamed north on a 30 to 40 kt low level jet to feed the system during the evening with 850 mb dew point temperatures in the area of 13° C.  Much of what the complex produced was heavy rainfall and gusty winds.  There were spotty reports of hail, but nothing of any real significance.  A few of the cells were severe.  The first report of severe weather in Iowa came from Plymouth County north of Sioux City.  Winds of 70 to 80 mph knocked down trees and caused some roof damage at a farmstead along County Road K22, about 10 miles north of Sioux City.  The storms moved into the city of Sioux City a short time later, uprooting trees and downing power lines.  A mobile home park was hit where several mobile homes were overturned and a few small buildings were knocked off their foundations.  There were other spotty reports of wind damage around northwest and west-central Iowa.  Road signs were blown over by the winds near Galva in Ida County.  The complex spawned a couple of small tornadoes.  The first touched down briefly west of Galva.  The county sheriff reported the tornado destroyed a few outbuildings during the brief time it was on the ground.  Another tornado touched down in Buena Vista County.  It first touched down south of Sulphur Springs.  It hit a farmstead there where it totally destroyed a garage.  The tornado tracked east across open country toward Newell.  The last report of damage was west of Newell, where several trees were downed along the tornado path.  The last tornado report came from southern Iowa much later.  A funnel cloud was sighted in the Guss area, about five miles north of Gravity, in Taylor County.  It touched down briefly, becoming a tornado, over a small lake there.  It was fortunate that it only made a cameo appearance as the area of touchdown was a camping area.  A nearby house was struck by lightning by the same storm.  Although there was no fire, the damage to the house was significant.  The lightning destroyed all of the wiring in the house and peeled the gutters off of it all the way around.  The storms produced high winds over a large area.  There were two injuries as a result of the winds.  As the storms moved through Buena Vista County, high winds buffeted the Lakeside area.  A campground on the west end of town was hit.  A total of eight tents were downed by the winds, two of which were mangled beyond repair.  Two campers were injured by flying debris.  The injuries were minor cuts and neither camper required hospitalization.",CSV

Several weather features caused the continual development.  There was an upper level disturbance approaching from the west, while a trough of low pressure approached from the northweSAINT  Farther  northwest was an approaching arctic cold front.  The atmosphere was very moist with deep moisture in place and convective available potential energy between 3000 and 3500 J-Kg-1 over much of the state.  Even so, the situation was not overly conducive to severe weather.  Thunderstorms moved over the west half of the state during the morning hours.  The east half remained under partly sunny skies with thunderstorms erupting during the early afternoon hours, once the weak cap had broken.  The storms produced heavy rainfall and some gusty winds.  Only a few became severe.  A severe thunderstorm moved through Winfield in Henry County, downing several trees.  Another storm produced a brief microburst south of Newton in Jasper County.  Many large tree limbs, up to 20 inches in diameter, were torn off.  Crops were flattened in a narrow strip for about a mile downstream.  Another storm produced a brief spin up tornado in Benton County.  The tornado was observed by a boater as it touched down on Rogers Park Lake.  It sucked up water briefly before breaking apart.  One could call it a waterspout since it did occur over water, however meteorologically it had thunderstorm structure of a land event.  For that reason it was listed as a tornado instead of a waterspout.  During the morning, thunderstorms moved through Clarion.  Lightning struck the chimney of the elementary school.  Several blocks were knocked out of the top of it and the chimney was cracked all the way down to its junction with the main building.",CSV

At landfall the minimum central pressure was 1000 mb and the maximum sustained wind was estimated at 58 mph. The maximum reported storm tide of 2.9 feet and the greatest rainfall total of 10.69 inches were observed at Apalachicola, but somewhat higher values likely occurred to the east of this location.  Beryl weakened to a tropical depression as it moved northeast into extreme southwest Georgia at 8 AM EST, July 16. There were no deaths and  only 1 injury directly attributable to Beryl and damage was estimated at $5.9 million.  Coastal damage included tidal flooding which undermined a few roads and houses and eroded beaches and sea walls.  A number of moored boats were damaged and three persons on a fishing boat offshore the panhandle had to be rescued.  Winds did minor roof damage and downed trees and signs along the coaSAINT Inland, trees were blown down damaging roofs and power was lost to 20,000 customers. The heavy rain caused flooding of low lying areas which lasted more than a week, damaging houses and vehicles. The oyster beds in Apalachicola Bay were once again contaminated.",CSV

A warm front moved northeast across the state during the day.  During the late afternoon hours a cold front approached the northwest corner of the state.  Very humid air was drawn north just ahead of the cold front.  Dew point temperatures were in the lower to middle 70s over most of the state by evening.  Northwest flow in the middle and upper levels brought in relatively cool air aloft over the area.  As a result the lifted indices were in the -10 to  -12. range.  By early evening, convective available potential energy values reached 4000-6000 J-Kg-1 over much of the west half of Iowa.  Thunderstorms fired in two areas initially.  The first was over southern Minnesota.  The second was over north central Nebraska.  The two areas propagated south and grew toward each other with time.  Though the storms were tornadic over Minnesota, the main severe weather event for Iowa was hail and high winds.  The Minnesota convection dropped into north central and northeast Iowa.  Dime-size hail was the result.  There were sporadic reports of marble to dime-size hail for about 45 minutes over Winnebago County.  Dime-size hail also fell over northwest Hancock County as the storms entered the Woden area.  After this time, they weakened as they continued to move south-southeaSAINT  As the mesoscale convective system over Nebraska built into southeast South Dakota and northwest Iowa, high winds and hail resulted.  Hail ranged in size from three quarter inch to golf ball in size.  In Cherokee County, hail damage was reported to many cars in the city of Cherokee by hail 2 inches in diameter.  Reports showed at least 150 cars and 100 homes were damaged by the hail.  A tornado touched down northwest of Sibley, in Osceola County.  One farmstead was hit with damage reported to several buildings, one was destroyed.  A woman received minor injuries when she was cut on the hand by flying glass.  Five hogs were killed when a concrete block building was collapsed.  The building housed 300 hogs.  A silo was destroyed on the farm and carried a mile to the south.  At the same time one of the cars was lifted and thrown 50 feet.  At about the same time, a farmhouse in rural Sibley was struck by lightning.  The house was set on fire and was totally loSAINT  Also in Osceola County, north of Sibley, a farmstead was hit by high winds in advance of the tornado.  A concrete was destroyed and the end of the barn was completely removed.  Woodbury and Monona Counties were hard hit by high winds.  The first reports came from Danbury, where 60 to 65 MPH winds were reported.  Numerous reports of trees and power lines being downed by high winds were received from Woodbury County.  In Monona County, Mapleton and the area around it were hard hit.  In the town of Mapleton, the roof was blown off of a car dealership, and the roof was caved in on one apartment building.  In the downtown area, winds blew out a three quarter inch thick plate glass window.  Several farmsteads were damaged by the winds as well.  Two farms had significant structural damage.  Another reported one grain bin blown off its foundation, and six others had the sides collapsed and bent over.  Twelve hogs were killed when a quonset building was destroyed.  One man was injured in Crawford County when high winds downed a large tree limb in front of the car that he was driving.  The storms continued south, though they had weakened with winds around 50 MPH.  Spotty damage occurred.  High winds downed trees and limbs in Harrison County at Dunlap and Pottawattamie County at Council Bluffs.  Several tents were blown down by the wind at the County Fair in Dunlap as well.  There were also several lightning strikes.  Lightning set a house on fire southwest of Sibley, destroying it.  A barn was a total loss to fire northeast of Mapleton when lightning struck it.  Another storm moved across Shelby County.  Lightning struck two house in Harlan.  Damage occurred to each, but actual dollar amount was not available.",CSV

Convective available potential energy was nearly 5000 J-Kg-1, with lifted indices in the -8 to -10 range given surface dew point temperatures in the middle to upper 70s.  Thunderstorms erupted over north central Nebraska into south central and southeast South Dakota.  The storms quickly organized into a mesoscale convective system, which took on a bow echo configuration as it traversed northeast Nebraska.  The principle feature with this event was high winds.  There was little significant hail and rainfall did not become excessive since the entire system was moving east at 45 MPH.  Sixty to 70 MPH winds raked parts of northeast Nebraska and southeast South Dakota.  The winds crossed the Iowa border around the stroke of midnight on the 5th.  Trees were downed and power cut off in several areas.  Some of the stronger winds moved through Crawford County.  The storms produced 65 MPH winds in Monona County before gaining strength.  In Crawford County, winds around 80 MPH ripped windows out of houses, caused some structural damage to others, and tore several barn doors off south and west of the town of Charter Oak.  Ida Grove, in Ida County, was also hard hit by the high winds.  Trees were downed and damage was reported to several houses.  County sheriff reports from the county indicate that tree and power line damage was extensive around the county.  The winds caused damage to crops in their path as well.  Though the crop was not destroyed, some yield loss was expected as many farmers reported the corn crop leaning.  Spotty damage was reported in the Iowa Great Lakes region as 70 MPH winds swept through the resort area.  The damage was not severe, but some campers were tipped over by the wind.  Winds around 75 MPH swept into Sioux County as well.  Significant damage was done to buildings on a farmstead near Hawarden.  Other structural damage occurred in Boyden.  Lightning struck a house in Le Mars.  The strike caused a gas line fire, however the fire was quickly contained.  The storms weakened rapidly during the early morning hours.  WSR-88D radar in Des Moines indicated the outflow boundary had advanced nearly 50 miles ahead of the line of thunderstorms.  Shortly after the outflow advanced so far ahead of the system, rapid weakening occurred.",CSV

Parameters for severe weather were weak.  The instability was there, but moisture, inflow, and shear were marginal.  A mesoscale convective system developed over Minnesota during the afternoon hours.  As the evening progressed, the storms developed toward the southweSAINT  Eventually the complex overspread about the northeast two thirds of Iowa.  Some severe weather was reported with the storms, but it was limited.  Since the storms occurred across the midnight hour, a few reports were included in the June Storm Data.  Dime-size and slightly larger hail fell in west central Iowa after the midnight hour.  Minor damage occurred in Arthur as one storm produced winds of nearly 60 MPH.  High winds in the Ida Grove area caused damage to two homes there as trees were toppled onto the houses.  There were other spotty reports of winds near 60 MPH from around the state, but they were quite isolated.  The storms continued east and south across the state during the night, but the system had transformed from a severe weather producer to a general rain event.  Urban flooding occurred in parts of Ida County.  Local street flooding in Ida Grove was as high as the car bumpers.  As the thunderstorms moved across Des Moines, lightning struck one of the buildings downtown.  The Equitable Insurance Building was struck by lightning on the 20th floor.  A decorative block was shattered and fell to the ground.  Lightning struck a tree in Manson.  A large branch was broken off and fell through the second floor window of a house there.  Minor roof damage was reported in addition to the broken window.",CSV

A 77 mph wind gust blew through Le Mars.  The winds caused roof damage to one building there.  Sixty to sixty five mph winds were reported at Remsen and Kingsley.

The airmass was extremely unstable with convective available potential energy between 5000 and 6000 J-Kg-1 over the northwest part of Iowa.  Feeding into the area was an area of dew point temperatures between 75 and 80 degrees.  This set the stage for explosive thunderstorm development.  A small area of thunderstorms fired up over northwest Iowa in Woodbury County.  As the evening progressed, a HP Supercell developed over the western part of the county and remained nearly stationary for several hours.  Actually the cell would drift slightly northeast with the environmental winds, then back-develop over the same area.  This resulted in flash flooding over a part of Woodbury County as around 5 inches of rain fell in two to three hours time.  The cell spawned numerous funnel clouds and one tornado.  The tornado touched down northwest of Salix, then drifted slowly southeaSAINT  Damage occurred in the Salix area.  First to be hit was in the rural areas northwest of town, where several grain bins were destroyed.  As the tornado moved into the city, two houses were damaged and two others destroyed.  A full size car was lifted and carried from a driveway, then deposited on its top.  Damage estimates were in the $200,000 range.  Fortunately, there were no injuries or deaths reported.  The tornado was actually visible for nearly two hours.  In all probability, this was a family of tornadoes from the parent supercell.  Other than the one cell, severe weather was rather spotty even though the storms developed into a bow configuration.  Sixty to 70 MPH winds were reported southeast of Le Mars as the gust front passed.  High winds downed power lines in Onawa.  The storms acted very much like the storms of the previous night.  A well defined outflow boundary was depicted on the WSR-88D radar at Des Moines.  The boundary advanced during the night until it was about 100 miles ahead of the complex by sunrise.  This cut off the inflow to the storms.  Lightning damage was reported in Sioux City.  In one strike, a garage was struck by lightning causing minor damage.  Later, a house was struck in town.  The house was set on fire.",CSV

The airmass remained very unstable with surface dew point temperatures in the lower to middle 70s.  The moisture layer was deep with 850 mb dew point temperatures around 15° C.  Thunderstorms occurred during the early morning hours over western Iowa.  The outflow boundary from that complex advanced into the central part of the state by sunrise.  Thunderstorms developed throughout the day along this outflow boundary.  During the afternoon hours they became severe.  Several tornadoes were spawned.  Two weak tornadoes touched down briefly in north central Iowa.  One was in Winnebago County, the other in Worth County.  Neither of them caused any significant damage as they occurred in open country.  A fairly strong tornado touched down in Chickasaw County.  The tornado touched down southwest of New Hampton and tracked northeaSAINT  It his a truck repair shop at the intersection of U.S. Highway 63 and County Highway B54.  The roof was removed from the repair facility.  Most of the tornado track was through open country, which kept damage to a minimum.  The same parent storm caused high winds at the intersection of U.S. Highway 63 and Iowa Highway 18.  The winds removed the roof from a car wash there and also damaged several cars in the parking lot there.  Debris from the tornado broke windows and punctured the tires on two trucks in the lot.  Another tornado made a cameo touchdown in a field north of Clermont in Fayette County.  In addition to the tornadoes, there were a few other funnel cloud reports.  None of these touched down to become tornadoes.  Many of the storms over the east half of the state produced gusty winds and small hail.  Only a few were strong enough to become severe.  One storm caused wind damage in Bremer County.  High winds blew the roof off of a barn and downed trees and power lines south of Plainfield.  Another storm uprooted several trees in Waverly.  Damage of $10,000-$15,000 was reported in Fredericksburg as high winds damaged the roof of a service station.",CSV
